Most of the posts in the Kudu blog have been written by the project's
committers and are either technical or news-like in nature. We'd like to hear
how you're using Kudu in production, in testing, or in your hobby project and
we'd like to share it with the world!

If you'd like to tell the world about how you are using Kudu in your project,
now is the time.

To learn how to submit posts, read our [contributing
documentation](/docs/contributing.html#_blog_posts). Alternatively, you can
draft your post to Google Docs and share it with us on
[dev@kudu.apache.org](mailto:dev@kudu.apache.org) and we're happy to review it
and post it to the blog for you.
