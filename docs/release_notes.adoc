[[rn_1.11.1]]
Apache Kudu 1.11.1 is a bug-fix release which fixes one critical licensing
issue in Kudu 1.11.0.

[[rn_1.11.1_upgrade_notes]]
== Upgrade Notes
When upgrading from earlier versions of Kudu, if support for Kudu's NVM
(non-volatile memory) block cache is desired, install the `memkind` library
of version 1.8.0 or newer as documented in link:installation.html[Kudu
Installation] for corresponding platform. This is a mandatory step for existing
users of the NVM block cache (i.e. those who set `--block_cache_type=NVM`
for `kudu-master` and `kudu-tserver`): they must install `memkind`, otherwise
their Kudu processes will crash at startup.

[[rn_1.11.1_fixed_issues]]
== Fixed Issues
* Fixed an issue with distributing `libnuma` dynamic library with `kudu-binary`
  JAR artifact. Also, fixed the issue of statically compiling in `libnuma.a`
  into `kudu-master` and `kudu-tserver` binaries when building Kudu
  from source in release mode. The fix removes both `numactl` and `memkind`
  projects from Kudu's thirdparty dependencies and makes the dependency on the
  `libmemkind` library optional, opening the library using `dlopen()` and
  resolving required symbols via `dlsym()`
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2990[KUDU-2990]).

[[rn_1.11.0]]
= Apache Kudu 1.11.0 Release Notes

[[rn_1.11.0_upgrade_notes]]
== Upgrade Notes

* Since link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2625[KUDU-2625] is
  addressed, tablet servers now reject individual write operations which
  violate schema constraints in a batch of write operations. In prior versions
  the behavior was to reject the whole batch of write operations if a violation
  of the schema constraints is detected even for a single row. It's recommended
  to revise applications which relied on the behavior mentioned above
  upon upgrading to Kudu 1.11.0.

[[rn_1.11.0_deprecations]]
== Deprecations

* The Kudu Flume integration is deprecated and may be removed in the
  next minor release. The integration will be moved to the Apache Flume
  project going forward
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FLUME-3345[FLUME-3345]).

[[rn_1.11.0_new_features]]
== New features

* Kudu now supports putting tablet servers into maintenance. While in this
  mode, the tablet server's replicas will not be re-replicated if it fails.
  Only upon exiting maintenance will re-replication be triggered for any
  remaining under-replicated tablets. The `kudu tserver state enter_maintenance`
  and `kudu tserver state exit_maintenance` tools are added to orchestrate
  tablet server maintenance, and the `kudu tserver list` tool is amended with
  a "state" column option to display current state of each tablet server
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2069[KUDU-2069]).

* Kudu now has a built-in NTP client which maintains the internal wallclock
  time used for generation of HybridTime timestamps. When enabled, system clock
  synchronization for nodes running Kudu is no longer necessary. This is useful
  for containerized deployments and in other cases when it's troublesome
  to maintain properly configured system NTP service at each node of a Kudu
  cluster. The list of NTP servers to synchronize against is specified with the
  `--builtin_ntp_servers` flag. By default, Kudu masters and tablet servers use
  public servers hosted by the NTP Pool project. To use the built-in NTP
  client, set `--time_source=builtin` and reconfigure `--builtin_ntp_servers`
  if necessary
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2935[KUDU-2935]).

* Aggregated table statistics are now available to Kudu clients via
  `KuduClient.getTableStatistics()` and `KuduTable.getTableStatistics()`
  methods in the Kudu Java client and `KuduClient.GetTableStatistics()`
  in the Kudu {cpp} client. This allows for various query optimizations.
  For example, Spark now uses it to perform join optimizations.
  The statistics are available via the API of both {cpp} and Java Kudu clients.
  In addition, per-table statistics are available via `kudu table statistics`
  CLI tool. The statistics are also available via master's Web UI at
  `master:8051/metrics` and `master:8051/table?id=<uuid>` URIs
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2797[KUDU-2797] and
   link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2921[KUDU-2921]).

* The `kudu` CLI tool now supports altering table columns. Use the newly
  introduced sub-commands such as `kudu table column_set_default`,
  `kudu table column_remove_default`, `kudu table column_set_compression`,
  `kudu table column_set_encoding`, and `kudu table column_set_block_size`
  to alter a column of the specified table.

* The `kudu` CLI tool now supports dropping table columns. Use the newly
  introduced `kudu table delete_column` sub-command to drop a column of the
  specified table.

* The `kudu` CLI tool now supports getting and setting extra
  configuration properties for a table. Use `kudu table get_extra_configs`
  and `kudu table set_extra_config` sub-commands to perform the corresponding
  operations
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2514[KUDU-2514]).

* The `kudu` CLI tool now supports creating and dropping range partitions
  for a table. Use `kudu table add_range_partition` and
  `kudu table drop_range_partition` sub-commands to perform the corresponding
  operations
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2881[KUDU-2881]).

[[rn_1.11.0_improvements]]
== Optimizations and improvements

* The `kudu fs dump uuid` CLI tool is now significantly faster and consumes
  significantly less IO.

* The memory consumed by CFileReaders and BloomFileReaders is factored out and
  accounted separately by the tablet server memory tracking. The stats are
  available via Web UI as "CFileReaders" and "BloomFileReaders" entries.

* `KuduScanBatch::const_iterator` in Kudu {cpp} client now supports
  `operator->()`
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-1561[KUDU-1561]).

* Master server Web UI now supports sorting the list of tables by the columns
  of "Table Name", "Create Time", and "Last Alter Time".

* Tablet servers now expand a tablet's data directory group with available
  healthy directories when all directories of the group are full
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2907[KUDU-2907]).

* For scan operations run with `CLOSEST_REPLICA` selection mode, the Kudu Java
  client now picks a random available replica in case no replica is located at
  the same node with the client that initiated the scan operation. This helps
  to spread the load generated by multiple scan requests to the same tablet
  among all available replicas. In prior releases, all such scan requests might
  end up fetching data from the same tablet replica
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2348[KUDU-2348]).

* The serialization of in-memory rows to Kudu's wire format has been optimized
  to be more CPU efficient
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2847[KUDU-2847]).

* Tablet servers and masters can now aggregate metrics by the same attribute.
  For example, it's now possible to fetch aggregated metrics from a tablet
  server by retrieving data from URLs of form
  `http://<host>:<port>/metrics?merge_rules=tablet|table|table_name`

* Introduced Docker image for Python Kudu client
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2849[KUDU-2849]).

* Tablet servers now consider available disk space when choosing a set of data
  directories for a tablet's data directory group, and when deciding in which
  data directory a new block should be written
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2901[KUDU-2901]).

* Added a quick-start example of using Apache Spark to load, query, and modify
  a real data set stored in Kudu.

* Added a quick-start example of using Apache Nifi to ingest data into Kudu.

* Tablet servers now reject individual write operations which violate schema
  constraints in a batch of write operations received from a client. The
  previous behavior was to reject the whole batch of write operations
  if a violation of the schema constraints is detected even for a single row
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2625[KUDU-2625]).

* Tablet replicas can now be optionally placed in accordance with a
  dimension-based placement policy. To specify a dimension label for a table,
  use the `KuduTableCreator::dimension_label()` and
  `CreateTableOptions.setDimensionLabel()` methods of the {cpp} and Java Kudu
  clients. To add a partition with a dimension label, use the
  `KuduTableAlterer::AddRangePartitionWithDimension()` and
  `AlterTableOptions.addRangePartition()` methods of the {cpp} and Java Kudu
  clients
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2823[KUDU-2823]).

* Kudu RPC now enables TCP keepalive for all outbound connections for faster
  detection of no-longer-reachable nodes
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2192[KUDU-2192]).

* The `kudu table scan` and `kudu table copy` CLI tools now fail gracefully
  rather than crashing upon hitting an error
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2851[KUDU-2851]).

* Optimized decoding of deltas' timestamps
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2867[KUDU-2867]).

* Optimized the initialization of DeltaMemStore for the case when no matching
  deltas are present
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2381[KUDU-2381]).

* Improved the rehydration of scan tokens. Now a scan token created
  before renaming a column can be used even after the column has been renamed.

* The memory reserved by tcmalloc is now released to OS periodically to avoid
  potential OOM issues in the case of read-only workloads
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2836[KUDU-2836]).

* Optimized evaluation of predicates on columns of primitive types and
  `NULL`/`NOT NULL` predicates to leverage SIMD instructions
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2846[KUDU-2846]).

[[rn_1.11.0_fixed_issues]]
== Fixed Issues

* Fixed an issue of fault-tolerant scan operation failing for a projection
  with key columns specified in other than the table schema's order
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2980[KUDU-2980]).

* Fixed an issue that would cause frequent leader elections in case when
  persisting Raft transactions to the WAL took longer than the leader
  election timeout. The issue was contributing to election storms
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2947[KUDU-2947]).

* Fixed a tablet server crash in cases where blocks were not removed due to IO
  error. This issue may have surfaced after recovering from a disk failure
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2635[KUDU-2635]).

* Fixed a crash in master and tablet server by validating the size of default
  values when de-serializing `ColumnSchemaPB`
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2622[KUDU-2622]).

* Fixed RPC negotiation failure in the case when TLS v1.3 is supported at
  both the client and the server side. This is a temporary workaround before
  the connection negotiation code is properly updated to support 1.5-RTT
  handshake used in TLS v1.3. The issue affected Linux distributions shipped
  or updated with OpenSSL version 1.0.2 and newer
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2871[KUDU-2871]).

* Fixed a race between `GetTabletLocations()` and tablet report processing.
  The race could crash the Kudu master
  (see link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU-2842[KUDU-2842]).

* Fixed a bug in `AlterSchemaTransactionState::ToString()` that led to a crash
  of tablet server when removing a tablet replica with a pending `AlterSchema`
  transaction.

[[rn_1.11.0_wire_compatibility]]
== Wire Protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.11.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.11 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0 or later. If the client uses
  features that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.10 and Kudu 1.11 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.11 with the exception of the
  below-mentioned restrictions regarding secure clusters.

The authentication features introduced in Kudu 1.3 place the following limitations
on wire compatibility between Kudu 1.11 and versions earlier than 1.3:

* If a Kudu 1.11 cluster is configured with authentication or encryption set to "required",
  clients older than Kudu 1.3 will be unable to connect.
* If a Kudu 1.11 cluster is configured with authentication and encryption set to "optional"
  or "disabled", older clients will still be able to connect.

[[rn_1.11.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client Library Compatibility

* The Kudu 1.11 Java client library is API- and ABI-compatible with Kudu 1.10. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.10 will compile and run against the Kudu 1.11 client library and
  vice-versa.

* The Kudu 1.11 {cpp} client is API- and ABI-forward-compatible with Kudu 1.10.
  Applications written and compiled against the Kudu 1.10 client library will run without
  modification against the Kudu 1.11 client library. Applications written and compiled
  against the Kudu 1.11 client library will run without modification against the Kudu 1.10
  client library.

* The Kudu 1.11 Python client is API-compatible with Kudu 1.10. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.10 will continue to run against the Kudu 1.11 client
  and vice-versa.
