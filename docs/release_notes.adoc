[[rn_1.7.0_upgrade_notes]]
== Upgrade Notes

* Upgrading directly from Kudu 1.6.0 is supported and no special upgrade steps
  are required. A rolling upgrade of the server side will _not_ work because
  the default replica management scheme changed, and running masters and tablet
  servers with different replica management schemes is not supported, see
  <<rn_1.7.0_incompatible_changes>> for details. However, mixing client and
  server sides of different versions is not a problem, i.e. you can still
  update your clients before your servers or vice versa.
  When upgrading to Kudu 1.7, it is required to first shut down all Kudu processes
  across the cluster, then upgrade the software on all servers, then restart
  the Kudu processes on all servers in the cluster.

[[rn_1.7.0_obsoletions]]
== Obsoletions

* The `tcmalloc_contention_time` metric, which previously tracked the amount
  of time spent in memory allocator lock contention, has been removed.

[[rn_1.7.0_deprecations]]
== Deprecations

* Support for Java 7 has been deprecated since Kudu 1.5.0 and may be removed in
  the next major release.

[[rn_1.7.0_new_features]]
== New features

* Kudu now supports the decimal column type. The decimal type is a numeric data type
  with fixed scale and precision suitable for financial and other arithmetic
  calculations where the imprecise representation and rounding behavior of float and
  double make those types impractical. The decimal type is also useful for integers
  larger than int64 and cases with fractional values in a primary key.
  See link:schema_design.html#decimal[Decimal Type] for more details.

* The `kudu fs update_dirs` tool now supports removing directories. Unless the
  `--force` flag is specified, Kudu will not allow the removal of a directory
  across which tablets are configured to spread data. If specified, all tablet
  replicas configured to use that directory will fail upon starting up and be
  replicated elsewhere, provided a majority exists elsewhere.

* Users can use the new `--fs_metadata_dir` to specify the directory in which
  to place tablet-specific metadata. It is recommended, although not
  necessary, that this be placed on a high-performance drive with high
  bandwidth and low latency, e.g. a solid-state drive. If not specified,
  metadata will be placed in the directory specified by `--fs_wal_dir`, or in
  the directory specified by the first entry of `--fs_data_dirs` if metadata
  already exists there from a pre-Kudu 1.7 deployment. Kudu will not
  automatically move existing metadata based on this configuration.

* Kudu 1.7 introduces a new scan read mode READ_YOUR_WRITES. Users can specify
  READ_YOUR_WRITES when creating a new scanner in both C++ and Java clients.
  If this mode is used, the client will perform a read such that it follows all
  previously known writes and reads from this client. Reads in this mode ensure
  read-your-writes and read-your-reads session guarantees, while minimizing
  latency caused by waiting for outstanding write transactions to complete.
  Note that this is still an experimental feature which may be stabilized in
  future releases.

== Optimizations and improvements
* Reporting for the `kudu cluster ksck` tool has been updated so tablets and
  tables with on-going tablet copies are shown as "recovering". Additional
  reporting changes have been made to make various common scenarios,
  particularly tablet copies, less alarming.

* KUDU-1097: a new replica management scheme is implemented and enabled by
  default. With the new replica management scheme, the system first adds a
  replacement tablet replica before evicting the failed one. With the previous
  replica management scheme, the system first evicts the failed replica and
  then adds a replacement. The new replica management scheme allows for much
  faster recovery of tablets in scenarios where one tablet server goes down and
  then returns back shortly after 5 minutes or so. To switch back to the old
  scheme, set the `--raft_prepare_replacement_before_eviction` run-time flag to
  `false` for *all* tablet servers and masters in Kudu 1.7 cluster.

[[rn_1.7.0_fixed_issues]]
== Fixed Issues

* KUDU-2312: The evaluation order of predicates in scans with multiple
  predicates has been made deterministic. Due to a bug, this was not necessarily
  the case previously. Predicates are applied in most to least selective order,
  with ties broken by column index. The evaluation order may change in the
  future, particularly when better column statistics are made available
  internally.

[[rn_1.7.0_wire_compatibility]]
== Wire Protocol compatibility

Kudu 1.7.0 is wire-compatible with previous versions of Kudu:

* Kudu 1.7 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.0 or later. If the client uses
  features that are not available on the target server, an error will be returned.
* Rolling upgrade between Kudu 1.6 and Kudu 1.7 servers is believed to be possible
  though has not been sufficiently tested. Users are encouraged to shut down all nodes
  in the cluster, upgrade the software, and then restart the daemons on the new version.
* Kudu 1.0 clients may connect to servers running Kudu 1.7 with the exception of the
  below-mentioned restrictions regarding secure clusters.

The authentication features introduced in Kudu 1.3 place the following limitations
on wire compatibility between Kudu 1.7 and versions earlier than 1.3:

* If a Kudu 1.7 cluster is configured with authentication or encryption set to "required",
  clients older than Kudu 1.3 will be unable to connect.
* If a Kudu 1.7 cluster is configured with authentication and encryption set to "optional"
  or "disabled", older clients will still be able to connect.

[[rn_1.7.0_incompatible_changes]]
== Incompatible Changes in Kudu 1.7.0

* The newly introduced replica management scheme is not compatible with the
  old scheme, so it's not possible to run pre-1.7 Kudu masters with
  1.7 Kudu tablet servers and vice versa, unless setting the run-time flag
  `--raft_prepare_replacement_before_eviction` to `false` for 1.7 masters
  and tablet servers. In essence, tablet servers cannot register with masters
  running with different replica management scheme. This is the server-side
  incompatibility only and it does not affect the client side. In other words,
  Kudu clients of prior versions are compatible with the Kudu server side
  running with either scheme, assuming the same replica management scheme
  is used by all masters and tablet servers in the Kudu cluster.
**  Kudu masters of 1.7 version will not register Kudu tablet servers of 1.6
    and prior revisions. To run 1.7 masters with the old scheme, set the
    `--raft_prepare_replacement_before_eviction` to `false`.
**  Kudu tablet servers of 1.7 version will not work with Kudu masters of 1.6
    and prior versions. To make the case of such misconfiguration easily
    detectable, Kudu tablet servers of 1.7 version crash when they detect their
    masters running with different replica management scheme. The crashing of
    tablet servers in such scenarios can be disabled by setting their
    `--heartbeat_incompatible_replica_management_is_fatal` run-time flag to
    `false`.

[[rn_1.7.0_client_compatibility]]
=== Client Library Compatibility

* The Kudu 1.7 Java client library is API- and ABI-compatible with Kudu 1.6. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.6 will compile and run against the Kudu 1.7 client library and
  vice-versa.

* The Kudu 1.7 {cpp} client is API- and ABI-forward-compatible with Kudu 1.6.
  Applications written and compiled against the Kudu 1.6 client library will run without
  modification against the Kudu 1.7 client library. Applications written and compiled
  against the Kudu 1.7 client library will run without modification against the Kudu 1.6
  client library.

* The Kudu 1.7 Python client is API-compatible with Kudu 1.6. Applications
  written against Kudu 1.6 will continue to run against the Kudu 1.7 client
  and vice-versa.

* Kudu 1.7 clients that attempt to create a table with a decimal column on a
  target server running Kudu 1.6 or earlier will receive an error response.
  Similarly Kudu clients running Kudu 1.6 or earlier will result in an error
  when attempting to access any table containing containing a decimal
  column.
